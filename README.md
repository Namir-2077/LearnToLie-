# LearnToLie-
LearnToLie! is a minimalist iOS rehearsal studio designed to help actors practice with structure, clarity, and measurable intent entirely offline. The project explores how thoughtful engineering can support artistic discipline, transforming solitary rehearsal into a focused, feedback-driven process.
