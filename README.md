# LearnToLie

**Master the art of vocal delivery and character-driven performance.**

LearnToLie is a cinematic Swift Playgrounds application designed for actors, speakers, and anyone looking to master the nuances of vocal conviction. Whether you're preparing for a role, a speech, or simply want to understand the mechanics of "vocal truth," LearnToLie provides a professional-grade training environment right on your iPad or Mac.


## The Philosophy

In acting, a "good lie" is simply a performance delivered with absolute conviction. This app helps you find that conviction by analyzing the technical components of your voice—pitch, pace, amplitude, and variation—and measuring them against the emotional intent of your performance.

## Key Features

### Script & Beat Management
* **Smart Parsing**: Import your own text or select from classic scenes like *Hamlet*, *Frankenstein*, and *Scent of a Woman*.
* **Beat Breakdown**: The app automatically breaks your script into manageable "beats," allowing you to focus on the emotional arc of every line.

### Memorization Lab
* **Progressive Removal**: Master your lines through a "vanishing word" system that forces you to internalize the text as it slowly disappears.
* **Accuracy Tracking**: Get real-time feedback on your accuracy as you recite the script from memory.

### Intensity & Context Evaluation
* **Character Hubs**: Define your performance by setting an **Origin** (where you start) and a **Destination** (the goal of the scene).
* **Intent & Motivation**: Select from a matrix of intents (Threaten, Persuade, Seduce, Deceive) and motivations (Power, Desperation, Survival).
* **AI Delivery Guidance**: Receive custom vocal tips and performance expectations (pitch range, energy level, breath pauses) tailored to your specific character context.

### Advanced Performance Analysis
* **Real-time Audio Metrics**: The app measures:
    * **Amplitude**: Are you projecting enough for a "Power" intent?
    * **Dynamic Variation**: Is your voice revealing the emotional landscape?
    * **Pacing & Silence**: Are your pauses intentional or hesitant?
    * **Consistency**: Does your energy hold throughout the delivery?
* **Performance Scoring**: Receive a 2.5–5.0 performance score based on how well your delivery aligned with your chosen intent.
* **Actionable Feedback**: Get a detailed breakdown of your strengths, specific improvements, and a "Masterclass Tip" for your next take.

## Technology Stack

* **SwiftUI**: A fluid, cinematic dark-mode interface with micro-animations.
* **Apple Speech Framework**: High-accuracy speech-to-text for memorization tracking.
* **AVFoundation**: Low-level audio monitoring for real-time amplitude and frequency analysis.
* **Natural Language Processing**: Intelligent beat parsing and word sequence matching.
